# yastan

Yet another implementation of the version of no U-turn Hamiltonian
Monte Carlo algorithm behind Stan.

## Introduction

Use the file play.jl play around with this version of Stan in Julia.
I'm using Julia 1.3.0 and the following packages

* Revise
* Plots
* Statistics
* LinearAlgebra
* RandomNumbers
* Zygote
* Distributed
* FFTW

There's a file named play.R which I use to compare my implementation of Stan
to the RStan (2.19.2) version of Stan.
