# yastan

Yet another implementation of Stan.

## Introduction

Use the file play.jl play around with this version of Stan in Julia.
I'm using Julia 1.3.0 and the following packages

* Revise
* Plots
* Statistics
* LinearAlgebra
* Distributions
* ForwardDiff
* Distributed
* FFTW

There's a file named play.R which I use to compare my version of Stan
to RStan's version of Stan.
